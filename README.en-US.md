## 📖 Project Introduction

Lofi Radio Web is a web-based implementation of [labilio/lofi-radio](https://github.com/labilio/lofi-radio), transforming the original Electron desktop application into a modern Web application.

**It's like bringing the background music of a coffee shop into your study** — no local audio files needed, no need to pick playlists, just open the page and listen.

### 🎯 Design Philosophy

- **Focus Experience**: A compact Dynamic Island player that stays present without getting in the way.
- **Cross-Platform**: A responsive web experience for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Instant Use**: No registration, login, download, or local music library required.
- **PWA Support**: Installable as a standalone window for a more app-like experience.

### 🧠 Why Lofi is Suitable for Focus

Lofi (Low Fidelity) music is often used for high-concentration tasks such as studying, programming, writing, and office work. Its typical characteristics include:

- **Slow and steady tempo** (usually 60-90 BPM)
- **Simple melodies with a strong sense of loop**
- **Minimal or no lyrics**
- **Soft tones**, often accompanied by rain sounds, vinyl crackle, or ambient noise
- **Restrained emotion**, avoiding artificial climaxes

These characteristics can make Lofi a less distracting choice for background listening:

1. **Fewer linguistic interruptions**: Minimal vocals are less likely to interrupt language-heavy work such as reading, writing, or coding.
2. **A predictable listening pattern**: Steady rhythms and loops avoid abrupt changes during longer sessions.
3. **A gentle sense of presence**: Soft textures can fill an overly quiet room without forcing an emotional climax.

> [!NOTE]
> Music affects everyone differently. Choose a sound and volume that suit your task, preferences, and environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `20.9` or higher (required by Next.js 16)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

> [!TIP]
> The repository includes `package-lock.json`. Use `npm ci` for a reproducible first install or in CI, and use `npm install` when intentionally updating dependencies.

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/88lin/lofi-radio-web.git
cd lofi-radio-web

# Install locked dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment Guide

> [!TIP]
> **Before deploying your own copy, fork this repository.**
>
> 1. Visit the [lofi-radio-web](https://github.com/88lin/lofi-radio-web) repository homepage.
> 2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right.
> 3. Once complete, you will see a copy of the `lofi-radio-web` repository under your own GitHub account.
>
> The deployment options below assume that you are using your fork.

### Pre-deployment Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project includes server-side APIs and is not a static site. The platform must support the Next.js Node.js server runtime and permit outbound server requests.

The runtime must provide:

- Runtime requirement: Node.js `>= 20.9.0`
- Application type: Standard Next.js server-side application (not a pure static site)
- API dependency: `/api/bilibili-stream` explicitly uses the Node.js runtime
- Outbound access: The deployment environment must allow server-side access to `api.live.bilibili.com` and `api.github.com`

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) matches the current repository structure and is the recommended hosting option.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/88lin/lofi-radio-web)

1. Click the button above, or visit the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Import your forked `lofi-radio-web` repository.
3. Keep the default Framework Preset as `Next.js`.
4. Use the default Build Command, or explicitly enter `npm run build`.
5. Use the default Install Command, or explicitly enter `npm install`.
6. Set the Node.js version to `20.x` or higher.
7. Current default public features usually don't require extra environment variables; just click `Deploy`.

If you later enable databases, authentication, or other extensions in your own branch, add the corresponding environment variables then.

### Deploy to Standard Node.js Server (Recommended)

If you use your own Linux server, cloud VM, PaaS, or panel, it is recommended to deploy as a standard Next.js Node service.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Start production service
npm run start
```

The default listening port is `3000`. If you need a reverse proxy, you can point Nginx / Caddy directly to this port.

A reference [Caddyfile](./Caddyfile) is included in the repository, suitable for reverse proxying in local or self-hosted scenarios.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

A ready-to-use [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) is provided in the root directory.

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t lofi-radio-web .

# Run container
docker run -d --name lofi-radio-web -p 3000:3000 --restart unless-stopped lofi-radio-web
```

Once the container starts, the application will execute `npm run start` inside the container, exposing port `3000` by default.

### Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / Other Platforms

> [!CAUTION]
> A static export cannot provide this project's server APIs. Before using Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or another platform, verify its Next.js server adapter, Node.js version, and outbound network policy.

Check these requirements carefully:

- This project contains server-side APIs, not just pure static pages.
- `/api/bilibili-stream` relies on the Node.js runtime and server-side outbound requests.
- Different platforms vary significantly in their support for Next.js server runtime, adapters, Node.js versions, and network policies.

If you are familiar with these platforms, you can validate a custom setup. Otherwise, prefer:

- Vercel
- Standard Node.js Server
- Docker + Reverse Proxy

## 🔄 Station Resource Maintenance

This project uses a "Base Source + Manually Curated Extensions" strategy for station resources:

- Base reference source: [labilio/lofi-radio](https://github.com/labilio/lofi-radio/blob/main/stations.json)
- Extension sources: Lofi Cafe, SomaFM, Code Radio, and other public streaming stations.

How to update:

1. Evaluate the availability and stability of a new station source.
2. Update the `stations` array in `src/lib/stations.ts`.
3. Synchronize the station list and total count in `README.md` and `README.en-US.md`.
4. Bump `siteLastUpdated` in `src/lib/seo-content.ts` — it drives the visible "last updated" label, the sitemap `lastmod`, and the `llms.txt` header.
5. Submit the changes.

### SEO Related Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/seo.ts` | Metadata, Open Graph, Twitter, Schema, robots and sitemap configuration |
| `src/lib/seo-content.ts` | FAQs, Lofi definition block, scene comparison table, source list; holds `siteLastUpdated` |
| `src/lib/llms.ts` | Builds `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` / `pricing.md` from station data |
| `src/app/robots.ts` | `/robots.txt` — declares 16 AI crawlers + Bingbot one by one, disallows `/api/` for all |
| `src/app/sitemap.ts` | `/sitemap.xml` — the four indexable pages |
| `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` | `/llms.txt` — AI site overview |
| `src/app/llms-full.txt/route.ts` | `/llms-full.txt` — full FAQ text and comparison table |
| `src/app/pricing.md/route.ts` | `/pricing.md` — machine-readable pricing and limits |
| `tests/seo.test.ts` | Asserts sitemap / robots / llms stay consistent with station data |

### Four maintenance rules

1. **Never hardcode the station count.** `llms.txt`, `pricing.md` and the JSON-LD all derive it from `stations.ts`; the READMEs are the only place that needs a manual sync.
2. **Bump `siteLastUpdated` whenever copy changes.** AI search weights freshness, and a stale hard-coded date is worse than none.
3. **Use native `<details>` for FAQs, not Radix Accordion.** Radix does not render collapsed content into the DOM, so non-rendering AI crawlers see zero answers.
4. **Keep the root layout to site-level JSON-LD only** (`Organization` + `WebSite`). Page-level nodes (`WebPage`, `CollectionPage`, `FAQPage`, `ItemList`) must be emitted by their own page, otherwise every sub-page also claims to be the homepage. A regression test in `tests/seo.test.ts` enforces this.
